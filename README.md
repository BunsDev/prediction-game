This project has been developed for educational purposes only and is not meant to be used for gambling.

This project demostrates how to build a smart contract based application using real time sports data via [Chainlink Functions](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions).

Additionally, the project showcases how to send automatic payouts using [Chainlink Automation](https://chain.link/automation) and how to transfer tokens cross-chain using [Chainlink CCIP](https://chain.link/cross-chain).

## Requirements
